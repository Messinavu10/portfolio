# Data Scientist

#### Technical Skills: Python, AWS, Spinnaker, Jenkins, TensorFlow 

## Education
- M.S., Data Science | University of California, Irvine (_December 2024_)
			        		
- B.S., Computer Science | University of San Diego (_May 2023_)

## Work Experience
**Software Engineering Intern @ Armory Inc. (_July 2022 - September 2023_)**
- Created new internal testing pipelines for an SAAS product known as Spinnaker, which allowed for testing of third-party software such as Open Policy Agent (OPA).
- Designed test pipelines in Jenkins to coordinate with Spinnaker services, which displayed the level of integration of Spinnaker to clients.
- Configured metric monitoring service known as Prometheus in conjunction with an Observability plugin to quantify and visualize data for Spinnaker services, which reduced pipeline execution times by 30%.
- Written shell scripts to gather crucial data from different namespaces in EKS clusters for automated monitoring of pod deployments.
- Created global lasting services for Jenkins and Prometheus by deploying them in individual pods in an EKS cluster and cutting down resource creation times by 50%.

## Projects
### Decentralized Identity System
[Repository] (put link here)

Led this senior Capstone project in collaboration with Transact Campus to create a secure identity platform for students on campus utilizing Microsoft Azureâ€™s verifiable credentials.
I designed a user-friendly web login portal in **Node.js** that makes calls to an Azure **SQL** database that allows for RBAC for different webpages and actions. Also utilized **Postman** to test http calls to gain access tokens for credentials made through **Microsoft Azure** services; eventually used Node.js to implement this process within the application.

### Painting vs. Photograph Classifier
[Repository] (put link here)

Designed and built a **python** program that uses machine learning algorithms such as perceptron and back propagation to classify whether a given input in a photograph or a painting.Was reponsible for manipulating the pixels of each individual image and used matrix operations for accurate results. Achieved over 80% accuracy with the learning algorithm.

### Compression and Decompression algorithm
[Repository] (put link here)

Programmed a Compression and Decompression algorithm for files using Hash Tables in Java. Compression reads a text file and shortens it to its binary components to reduce storage size.
Decompression does the opposite and returns file to original state. Hash Table was used to manage and retrieve entries from files that are being iterated and contain various get and set methods.
